# Webscraping-with-python
- This is a personal project of mine in which I used the python BeautifulSoup library and HTML to web scrape data from a Malaysia well-known real estate website called i-Property. 

- The purpose of this project is to gather crucial information such as rental price, agent contact number , rental area and square feet of properties in Kuala Lumpur

 -All the data which I obtained was imported to a CSV file. You may find the source code for the project in the GitHub link provided
